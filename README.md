This a lightweight tool using a Terminal User Interface (TUI), which allows opening, viewing, editing and saving of standard CSV files. 
Written in Rust. (By the way, that bird is a Tūī, a songbird native to my home country, New Zealand)

## How to install & run

- download the latest release version based on your operating system
    - note: windows version is currently bugged, refer to issues for more details
- run executable from terminal

## Current TODO List

- add separate page for tool functions/commands
- add debugview

## Demonstration

Here's an example of how the main interface for the editor looks. I have added dummy data to demonstrate how the editor handles data which is wider than the column width.
